/**
 * First problem: you want to create a skill which does something whenever
 * a player attacks a given entity, but you have to listen to all the attack
 * types: ranged attacks with bows, melee attacks with sword... and even abilities.
 * We need some event to generalize every attack, which is {@link PlayerAttackEvent}
 * <p>
 * A PlayerAttackEvent is called WHENEVER a player attacks, by any way, an entity.
 * This is super useful for MMOCore skills and other external plugins.
 * <p>
 * Second problem: if a player shoots another entity, it's not hard to get the
 * damaging entity, the arrow and trace back its shooter. However, if an external
 * plugin damages an entity WITHOUT telling Spigot that the player is the damage
 * source, it's IMPOSSIBLE to trace back the initial damager.
 * <p>
 * DamageManager gives a way to let MythicLib know that some player damaged some
 * entity. Basically MythicLib is monitoring every single attack from every single
 * player to keep track 1) of the initial caster, 2) of the damage types, that
 * is whether it is a SKILL or WEAPON attack.
